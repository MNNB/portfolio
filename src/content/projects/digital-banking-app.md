## Overview

The Digital Banking App project aimed to revolutionize how users interact with their finances through a mobile-first approach. The challenge was to simplify complex banking operations while maintaining security and trust.

## Problem Statement

Traditional banking apps often overwhelm users with features and complex interfaces, leading to confusion and frustration. Our goal was to create an intuitive experience that makes banking accessible to everyone.

## Design Process

### Research & Discovery
- Conducted user interviews with 50+ participants
- Analyzed competitor products
- Identified key pain points in existing solutions

### Key Findings
1. Users want quick access to common actions
2. Security features should be visible but not intrusive
3. Financial insights need to be easily digestible

## Solution

We developed a clean, minimalist interface that prioritizes the most common banking tasks while making advanced features easily accessible through an intuitive navigation system.
